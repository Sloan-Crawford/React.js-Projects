// ================ React.js complete notes ===================

// React is an open source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. 
// It is currently maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a large community of developers. 
// also has a sister library (React Native): provides architecture to native iOS & Android applications.

// setting up (easy way):
// first, get React and Babel cdn script tags (React for development to allow for debugging, babel.min).
// JSX preprocessor - adding type="text/babel" to the index.js script. NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION.

// start using react right away with:
// ReactDOM (global object)
// render() (method)
// syntax: React.DOM.render(what, where)
